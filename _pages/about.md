Hi! I'm Haoyang Wu, a junior CS major student at the University of Michigan. I'm also pursuing a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), expected to graduate in 2027.

Currently, my research interests lie in machine learning theory and model interpretability, advised by Prof. [Wei Hu](https://weihu.me). Previously, at SJTU, I was deeply engaged in surgical robotics as a research assistant at the [SIRIUS Lab](https://banyutong.github.io/sirius_lab_website/index.html#research), I am especially grateful for the mentorship of Prof. [Yutong Ban](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yban/), and had the honor of collaborating with Dr. [Tsun-hsuan Wang](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://zswang666.github.io/&ved=2ahUKEwi6otuVlbGPAxX9g4kEHbRgMOQQFnoECBMQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3oMe-gRD9lMPywO1SvhM8O).

**I am actively seeking research collaborations of all kinds. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss potential projects!**
