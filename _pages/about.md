Hi there! I'm Haoyang Wu, a junior CS major student at the University of Michigan. I'm also pursuing a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), expected to graduate in 2027.

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and robot learning. I'm currently a member of the [ARM Lab](https://arm.robotics.umich.edu) directed by [Prof.Dmitry Berenson](https://berenson.robotics.umich.edu). Previously, at SJTU, I was deeply engaged in surgical robotics as a research intern at the [SIRIUS Lab](https://banyutong.github.io/sirius_lab_website/), I am especially grateful for the mentorship of [Prof. Yutong Ban](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yban/), and had the honor of learning from and collaborating with [Dr. Johnnson Tsun-hsuan Wang](https://zswang666.github.io).

**I am actively seeking research collaborations and industry internships in AI-related areas. You can find my resume [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/Resume_Haoyang Wu_internship.pdf)**
