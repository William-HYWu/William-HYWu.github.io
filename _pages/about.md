Hi! I'm Haoyang Wu, a junior CS major student at the University of Michigan. I'm also pursuing a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), expected to graduate in 2027.

Previously at SJTU, I'm passionate about surgical robotics and worked as a research assistant at the [SIRIUS Lab](https://banyutong.github.io/sirius_lab_website/index.html#research), supervised by Prof. [Yutong Ban](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yban/). Currently, I am working to broaden my research experience computer vision (including medical imaging), robot learning, and theoretical machine learning topics.

**I am actively seeking research opportunities of all kinds. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss potential projects!**
